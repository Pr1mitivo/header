    <h1>The blockquote element</h1>

    <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>

    <blockquote <blockquote cite="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1149">
  <p>
    Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low altitude
    service. The connection topology is limited to a single point-to-point path
    for each carrier, used with standard carriers, but many carriers can be used
    without significant interference with each other, outside early spring. This
    is because of the 3D ether space available to the carriers, in contrast to
    the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3. The carriers have an intrinsic collision
    avoidance system, which increases availability.

    <h1>The Paragraph</h1>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
